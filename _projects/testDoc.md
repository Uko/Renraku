order: 7
name: Test-Document Framework
description: As any piece of software, static analysis rules also need automated tests. Writing them is a slightly complicated process, as one has also to create code snippets with good and bad code and then test whether the rule detects issues in the bad code fragments and does not detect them in the good ones. Documentation is another common software development practice which quality rules should follow. And if we already have these good and bad code examples, why not include them in the documentation to better explain the intention for the quality rule. The goal of this project is to develop a framework where a developer is only supposed to provide code snippers for the rule, and the framework will use them for testing and documentation generation.
