name: Critiques for the "Ring" Common Model
description: With Renraku we can provide critiques about any object, but the current rules mostly focus on CompiledMethod and Behavior. A problem arrises when one wants to validate a code which is not installed in the image. Pharo uses (or should use) the Ring model which is a common code model used by all the tools. The goal of this milestone is to build rules that work on Ring objects polymorphic with the existing classes and methods, and see how we can use them for validating a code which is not installed in the code.
