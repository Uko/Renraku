name: Smart Error Handling
description: At the moment Renraku ignores exceptions signaled by static analysis algorithms to protect users against spontaneous crashes. On the other hand algorithm developers need to disable this guard to detect and debug errors in their code. To improve awareness of casual programmers and remove burden from algorithm developers we need smart error handling in Renraku where the presence of runtime exceptions will be reported together with other external properties of code.
