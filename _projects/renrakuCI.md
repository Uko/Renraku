order: 5
name: Renraku on CI Validation
description: The CI server of Pharo still uses the old model of SmallLint rules, which have their own limitations. We have to migrate the CI validation rule to the Renraku model and benefit from single critique format in all out tools. Imagine that the CI server will serialize a critique object and send it to you by email. Just throw the file into your image and address the critique.
