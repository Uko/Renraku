name: Match-Rewrite Tool
description: Smalltalk Pattern code can be used to match and rewrite smalltalk code is a very declarative way. On the other hand syntax is not easy to memorize and understand, while matching process itself is hard to debug. Over the last few years a couple of tools were developed to aid developers with the Pattern code. MatchTool performs the matching and allows one to inspect the results and build the match query incrementally. RewriteTool focuses on the code transformations and can be used to create static analysis rules. While the tools do a good job, we need a single tool to browse, create, analyze, edit, and remove static analysis rules based on the Pattern code.
