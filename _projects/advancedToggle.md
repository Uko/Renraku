description: At the moment developers can ban the rules from checking their code on a method, class and package levels. But some rules that explain Pharo idioms may be annoying for experienced developers who have to break the idioms for a specific reasons. This is why we need a way to disable rules for a whole image. On the other hand there are some rules as "Uncommented Class" that have to check Pharo Kernel classes despite decisions of casual developers, as uncommented classes will not be accepted into Pharo anyway. Thus we also need a way to enforce rules for certain Packages.
