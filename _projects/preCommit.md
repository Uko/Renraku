name: Pre-commit Quality Feedback
description: 'Most of the tools based on Renraku provide either live feedback as-you-program or an on-demand analysis. We need a quality feedback that works during a commit process: when a developer is about to commit new changes the tool would tell him whether new critiques appeared. Then we can shift the rules such as "Uncategorized Method" or "Uncommented Class" from live feed to pre-commit feedback.'
