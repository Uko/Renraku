'To have quality assistant (and maybe other tools) pick up your changes you have to reset the cache. Do this by going to

System > Settings > Code Browsing > QualityAssistant > Renraku > Rule Cache

and pressing the reset button. Or simply executing

ReRuleManager reset


When you load complete rules into the system, the cache will be reset automatically. But as you are creating a new rule and it is in the incomplete state you have to reset the cache once you are ready.'
