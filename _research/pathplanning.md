description: Given information of a target and obstacles we are trying to implement various path planning algorithms like grid-based navigation, A star algorithm, potential path planning for AUV and compare there efficiency under water. This project is in collaboration with Lokesh Singh, who is a Research Assistant at IIT Kanpur and hold expertise in the field of robotic path planning.
