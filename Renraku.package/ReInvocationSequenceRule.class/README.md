I am checking for the violation in message sequences.

Subclass me and rewrite initialization method to all super initialize and then all the sequences with the methods for adding protocol.

Check the class side examples for examples.

You have to call
ReRuleManager reset
to make changes take place!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
