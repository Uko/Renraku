description: CriticBrowser is a veteran tool for static analysis that relied on SmallLint static analysis and existed in Pharo for many years. Renraku started as a wrapper of SmallLint and still shares may static analysis rules with the old system. During the work on Renraku we learned many important approaches to suggest automated fixes or detect issues more precisely. Lately CriticBrowser was ported to Renraku, and so all the features originally developed for QualityAssistant are now available in CriticBrowser.
