description: Calypso is a new superior code browser for Pharo, which is hopefully going to replace Nautilus in one or two years. It may seem to be not a big deal, but Calypso also provides static analysis support based on Renraku. This quality reporting feature of Calypso was not implemented by the developers of Renraku, which is already a success story, meaning that the API and other support is good enough for the other to build on top. But the fact that all the static analysis implemented for Renraku will continue to work in Calypso is absolutely amazing. For example a very nice static analysis system called Usage Contracts was lost, as it used a custom integration with the old Pharo code browser, which was then replaced by Nautilus.
