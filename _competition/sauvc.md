description: The Singapore AUV challenge aims to provide students an opportunity to experience the challenges of AUV system engineering and develop skills in the associated technologies. The focus is on autonomous operations in a swimming pool format, rather than remote control in a small tank, and it is aimed at University and Polytechnic students. The Singapore AUV challenge emphasizes on outreach, learning and skill development. The competition is open to Singapore and international participants.
